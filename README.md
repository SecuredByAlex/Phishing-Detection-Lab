# Phishing-Detection-Lab

## Objective

The Phishing Email Analysis Challenge is designed to enhance participants' ability to identify, analyze, and mitigate phishing threats using the Let's Defend platform. The challenge focuses on improving email security awareness, understanding social engineering tactics, and applying forensic analysis techniques to detect malicious emails. By engaging in this hands-on experience, participants will develop critical skills necessary for cybersecurity roles such as Security Analysts and Incident Responders.

### Skills Learned

- Identifying phishing indicators and suspicious email patterns.
- Analyzing email headers, metadata, and attachments for malicious content.
- Understanding common social engineering techniques used in phishing attacks.
- Applying threat intelligence and security tools to detect and mitigate email threats.
- Enhancing incident response capabilities for handling phishing incidents effectively.

  
### Tools Used

- Let's Defend platform for interactive email analysis and simulation.
- Email header analysis tools (e.g., MXToolbox, CyberChef) for metadata examination.
- Threat intelligence sources for identifying phishing domains and indicators of compromise (IoCs).
- Sandboxing and malware analysis tools for inspecting email attachments and links.
- Security awareness frameworks to recognize and prevent phishing attempts.
